# Working Groups

Working Groups provide a formal avenue for disparate groups to collaborate
around a common problem, craft a balanced position, and disband. Because they
represent the interests of multiple groups, they are a vehicle for consensus
building. If code is developed as part of collaboration within the Working
Group, that code will be housed in an appropriate repository as described in
the repositories document. The merging of this code into the repository will be
governed by the standard policies regarding submitting code to that repository
