about: Incubating program are activities that the TiDB community uses to incubate specific new features or projects. Participants can submit RFCs to this repo first. If the RFC is approved by most PMC members, an incubation project group will be established, which will involve community contributors (including PingCAP members) and a working group will be established in Community to promote the project.
