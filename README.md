### How to contribute

Contributions are welcomed and greatly appreciated. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.

You can start by finding an existing issue with the
[help-wanted](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
label in the tidb repo. These issues are well suited for new contributors. BTW,
there's always a need for more test coverage. You can also start with an area
that has [low coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/pingcap/tidb).

You can also join one of the [active working groups](./working-groups) to
participate in a community activity. Start attending working group meetings and
join the slack channel.
